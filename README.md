# cheat-sheet-creator
Cheat sheet in a convenient format for any linux command.

After 1 week of learning Bash, I decided to create a program that may be useful for some users of the Linux system. What if you want to learn all about a particular command? and if you want to learn several at once?
Here you may need the program cheatsheetcreator.
Easily get available in the Linux system information about the command you need(available whereis, man, help) and all in one file, in a user-friendly form, which can be printed in the future, so you can always refer to it without problems.
